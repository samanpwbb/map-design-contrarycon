  What does map design do?
  </span>
  <notes>I want to step back from Mapbox and ask a bigger question. I'm not an expert, but I dig into the past for inspiration, both as a map designer, and as a product designer. Cartographers were doing things by hand decades ago that we still can't do with a computer. It's funny being part of a team that's trying to catch up to the 1950s.</notes>

  Pre-enlightenment maps

  <notes>Even everyday maps were beautiful, because they were hand made, and the person at the desk got to fudge the truth a little in order to create a better looking and easier to use map (standard oil - 1930). These maps are also interesting because they're designed to match the Standard Oil brand. The whole pamphlet works together:</notes>

  <notes>I threw this in here in honor of the conference theme. Derive, map switch up (upside down, wrong city), ect. The maps highlight the way architecture and urban planning control behavior. The maps are designed to be tools for subverting that control. Bend reality in playful ways. This traditon lives on in some interesting ways today in web cartography.</notes>

  1970 - Today
  </span>
  <notes>Over time, maps become more practical and less expresive. Late 20th century, computers + the world's need for accurate maps above all else took over. Maps are essential tools, so they have to work really really well. So they get standardized and optimized and we think about everything except for the poetry that was at the very root of cartography.</notes>

  Making map design accessible

  <notes>
  Today: data needs to be worldwide, accurate. Maps must be useful. Maps need to be able to zoom, so you have to design with lots of flexibility. But maps should be beautiful and personal too. We're here try to reduce as much complexity as possible, without taking away control, in order to map design accessible.
