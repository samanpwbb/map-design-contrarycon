  Learning from the past
  </span>
  <notes>
  I'm not an expert. Background is in art + design, not maps and cartography. Look to past for inspiration. As a map designer and as a product designer. As far back as you can go, cartographers were doing things that we still can't do with a computer. As you will see, Mapbox is still trying to catch up.

  <notes>
  The maps say as much about the culture that made the map as they do about the geography. Data gathered by word of mouth from travelers, myths and stories. No rather than real surveying. Early maps tended to be careless about the ground truth. Religious imagery. The map was a way of expressing our replationship to the world, both physically and spiritually.

  <notes>
  The best maps. Crafted by skilled drafters and cartographers. Three types: consumer road maps, picture maps, and thematic maps
  Cars were suddenly widespread, we were shipping goods across the country, populations were growing and we needed to plan cities, and people went on road trips. The demand for maps was high.

  <notes>Even everyday maps were beautiful, because they were hand made, and the person at the desk got to fudge the truth a little in order to create a better looking and easier to use map (standard oil - 1930). These maps are also interesting because they're designed to match the Standard Oil brand. The whole pamphlet works together:</notes>

  <notes>
  In honor of the conference theme. Derive, map switch up (upside down, wrong city), ect. The maps highlight the way architecture and urban planning control behavior. The maps are designed to be tools for subverting that control. Bend reality in playful ways. This traditon lives on in some interesting ways today in web cartography.</notes>

  <notes>
  Late 20th century, the world's need for accurate update to date maps top priority. Maps are essential tools, so they have to work really really well. So they get standardized and optimized and we think about everything except for the poetry that was at the very root of cartography.
